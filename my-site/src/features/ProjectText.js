            Being able to create a simple static website using much more up-to-date 
            technology and tools was always a big goal for me after I was able to 
            work on NewsBox. This website uses 2 Docker containers to run and is being 
            hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet. First, the more robust container has Node 
            running, builds my React project, and uses Nginx to set a server to listen for 
            incoming requests. I wanted to practice using more than 1 container and start 
            using a proxy server to handle incoming internet traffic. Which leads into the second 
            container, this project was an introduction to Nginx to get a better 
            feel while using this tool. For now, the Nginx container only has the one job of handling 
            incoming users but I also would like to learn things such as load balancing. 
            Cloudflare was used to secure all connections and provides an SSL certificate. I did look into hosting on 
            AWS and was able to get the project up and running there, but saw that DigitalOcean offered 
            more of what I was looking for.

            I have always wanted to make a product that people are able to use and I have chosen 
            to make a communication application. The problem I would like to fix is as follows: 
            “I want to get together with my friends but it is hard to compile what days are good 
            for each person and what activity the group would like to do.” The difficulty of lining 
            up a date where everyone is free can be complicated especially if everyone is busy so 
            I want to make an app that makes the process more streamline. As for what I will use 
            to make this app, I know I want to use Docker, Nginx, MySQL, RabbitMQ. I am currently 
            considering using NextJS with Typescript for this project and there are probably many 
            more tools and aspects that I cannot see yet which I will have to use.

                React or NextJS, but I can see myself using whatever I find best`,

            This was the first major project that I worked on during Undergrad where I 
            started to understand how all the small pieces can interact. The task was to 
            make an application, with the stipulation that some of the parts needed to be 
            made by hand for the sake of complete understanding. Over the course of 4 months, 
            in a group, we created 4 virtual machines where each machine was a microservice 
            with a specific task. The 4 machines were seen as Front-End, Back-End, RabbitMQ, 
            and API. Most parts of the project were rushed and unpolished to a degree that 
            I did not like. In spite of that, the application worked, and it showed me that 
            creating an application was what I wanted to do.
